  - `trackQuerystring`: Control whether query parameters are included in pageviews (default: true)
  - `trackOutbound`: Enable/disable outbound link tracking (default: true)
  - `autoTrackPageview`: Control initial pageview tracking on SDK init (default: true)
  - `skipPatterns`: Client-side URL filtering with wildcard pattern support
- **Pattern Matching System**: Efficient client-side filtering to reduce unnecessary requests
  - Wildcard support: `*`, `/admin/*`, `*/debug/*`, `*temp*`
  - Multiple pattern matching with first-match priority
  - Graceful handling of invalid patterns
  - Performance-optimized regex conversion

### Enhanced
